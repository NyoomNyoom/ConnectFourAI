## About

This is the github repo for a connect four AI project that I am working on :). All the code I write will be tested to make sure that it works thourghly. Firstly I have had to make my own game for the ai to actually play, and now I am working on creating a more visual version of the game and also working on a random "AI" to play the game by placing a counter in a random column each time.

## Current Functionality
- A barebones GUI
- A Command Line Interface
- A random AI
- Ability for the users to play against the random AI

## Next Steps
Below are features that I would like to add, and features that I feel like I need to add.

### Must adds
- A more streamlined and pretty GUI
- A MinMax AI
- Win/lose checking
  
I am hoping to add tthe following features:
- A Genetic AI
- A way to assess how good a certain AI is vs a user, etc.
