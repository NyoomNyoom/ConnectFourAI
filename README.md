## About

This is the github repo for a connect four AI project that I am working on :). All the code I write will be tested to make sure that it works thourghly. Firstly I have had to make my own game for the ai to actually play, and now I am working on creating a more visual version of the game and also working on a random "AI" to play the game by placing a counter in a random column each time. 

## Expected Features

I am hoping to add tthe following features:
- A Gui
- A Random AI
- A minmax Ai
- A Genetic AI
- A way to assess how good a certain AI is vs a user, etc.
